Feature Selection 
-----------------
I refer you to the README and features.txt files in the original dataset to learn more about the feature selection for this dataset. A

The assignment explicitly states "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement." I have summarized the test measurements in such a manner for this project. 

The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are: 

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation

Other estimates have been removed for the purpose of this excercise.
